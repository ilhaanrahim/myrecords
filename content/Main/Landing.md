> Only when certain events recur in accordance with rules or regularities, as is the case with repeatable experiments, can our observations be tested in principle - by anyone. We do not take even our own observations quite seriously, or accept them as scientific observations, until we have repeated and tested them. Only by such repetitions can we convince ourselves that we are not dealing with a mere isolated 'coincidence'.
